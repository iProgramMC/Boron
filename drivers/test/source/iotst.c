Abstract:
	This module implements the I/O test.
	
	This tests the CreateFile, OpenFile, ReadFile, and WriteFile
	APIs.  Later it will also test CreateSectionFromFile,
	MapViewOfSection, UnmapViewOfSection, MapViewOfFile, and
	UnmapViewOfFile.  Except that these APIs may or may not
	exist, who knows.
